When you visit this site you will see what is currently available. To order some of the foods you need to click on "**Order a food**", then you will be presented with a form that you will fill out, and that's it... you have ordered...
You will notice that the number of sandwiches after the order is reduced by 10.

The site administrator can add new foods ("**Add food into the database**") and view all orders("**All orders**").
(The order we just made previously appeared on the orders).
If the food is delivered click on "**Delivered**" and it will be crossed out.
